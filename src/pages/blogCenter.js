        If you had to pick one moment for your makeup to well and truly play ball, your wedding day would likely be up there. Dewy, but not disco ball-esque, natural but not dull - and it has to be sweat-proof and camera-proof for obvious reasons.

        <p class="card-text text-light">  
        Start by cleaning your skin with a cleanser and following it up with a moisturiser. Donâ€™t forget to apply an under-eye cream to ensure your concealer goes on smoothly and does not settle into creases. Concealer in makeup can do a lot of things.
